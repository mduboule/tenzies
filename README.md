# Tenzies

Based off the material presented by Bob Ziroll in his 2022 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8](Tutorial for React JavaScript Library). 
Nothing drastically different from the version presented in his lesson except for a few different
small things:
- use SCSS and write cleaner styles
- add feature: save state locally (local storage)
- logic for the guard clauses in the useEffect hook for checking the winning conditions
- logic in the `allNewDice()` function
- logic in the `holdDice()`function

Nothing crazy though. Really enjoyed this class, thanks Bob Ziroll!
